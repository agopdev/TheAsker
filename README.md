# TheAsker
A simple open-source mobile game made with .NET MAUI, which consists of a trivia game featuring different Linux distros.

This game is designed for use on mobile operating systems (OS) devices. While it can be tested on Windows or Mac, the interface looks better on mobile devices.

The objective of the game is to score 3 points before reaching a total of 5 questions. If you achieve 3 points, you win; otherwise, you will lose.

Enjoy the game!
